# MI50 performance updates

Thanks to the excellent work of some community members:

- https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/16291
- https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/16208
- https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15927
- https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15982
- https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15884

there have been a number of optimisations that should provide some significant improvements to MI50 performance.

But how do they stack up?

# Configuration

The older version is:
```

The newer version is:
```

```

Configure arguments are:
```bash
HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -R)" CUDACXX="/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin/nvcc" cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx906 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_RPC=ON -DLLAMA_CURL=OFF -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON -DGGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86 -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=true -DGGML_SCHED_MAX_COPIES=1
```

Model specific settings:
- Snowpiercer (15B) was run on 1 MI50 in Q6_K
- Negative Anubis (70B) was run in Q4_K_S, 8x MI50
- Twilight Miqu (146B) was run in Q4_1, 8x MI50
- DeepSeek 3.1 (671B A37B) was run in Q2_K_XL, 8xMI50, 1x3090 (it does not actually fit across 8x MI50 despite being <256GB unless you split layers across multiple GPUs)
- GLM4.5 (355B A32B) was run in Q4_1, 8x MI50
- GPT4 OSS (120B A5.1B) was run in Q8_0, 3x MI50 (not its native MXFP4)

# Graph

![graph comparison](images/improvement.png)

Overall: These numbers are in percentage compared to the old i.e. `((new - old) / old)`. 0% means same speed as before. +100% means twice as fast.

Nothing is now slower by any statistically significant degree.

Comparing by model:

- Snowpiercer (blue) - no improvement on prompt processing, but a huge increase in token generation that only gets better as context increases. You can see [here](mi50-vs-3090.md) how it diminishes slower.
- Negative Anubis (cyan) - this one, unusually does get a fairly significant boost in prompt processing. I double-checked the benchmark, because it seems none of the others really did. Inference is also up by quite a bit more than the others at short contexts. This one looks more like it was fixing a performance bug than providing a similar speedup to the others.
- Twilight Miqu (green) - this one's interesting to benchmark because it's one of the biggest dense models out there - the product of some absolutely crazy merge work between a bunch of different models. This one got a slight boost at prompt processing and a moderate inference boost.
- DeepSeek 3.1 (yellow) - A small ~10% boost to token generation. This one still seems to use a ton of CPU even when fully offloaded so I think there's some sort of problem going on here.
- GLM4.5 (pink) - A quite good performance increase, but it was already quite quick before.
- GPT4-OSS (magenta) - A bit more performance increase at lower contexts than GLM4.5.
